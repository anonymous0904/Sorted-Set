# Sorted-Set
Sorted Set using a Doubly Linked List on Array

There are programming languages ​​that don't support pointers, therefore creating a linked list is only possible using arrays. This project represents the implementation of a sorted set and the possible operations (adding/deleting/searching for an element and checking if the container is empty). Being a sorted collection, it needs a relationship that defines the order of the elements. This data structure is accompanied by an iterator that facilitates the operations.
